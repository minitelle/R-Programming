Notes to self - 

yup yup yup, read this. If you are taking the class you are likley to wonder why the heck you are getting stuck 
after speding hours watching the lectures and feeling like you have learnt nothing. 
You could be totally new at R (I am), so here what you will find not one, but about 3/4 of the people taking this class say.

1. Course material is not leading to undersatanding the assignments. Take with a grain of salt. 
2. Swirl is nice but yeah turn off fun mode unless you like cheerleaders. It's a nice into but by the end you will still 
be a beginner, it's a cool intro.
3. Search engines are a wonderful getaway to great learning sources. Berkelely EDU, Standford EDU, stackoverflow, etc. R programmers
like to share and help, that in itself is awesome.
